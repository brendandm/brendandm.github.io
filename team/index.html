        <h4>Chesapeake Bay Funders Network</h4>
        
        <p>The Chesapeake Bay Funders Network (CBFN) is a funding collaborative dedicated to improving the capacity within communities to initiate and sustain change necessary to promote and protect the health of the Chesapeake Bay. The CBFN established Chesapeake Commons in 2011 to encourage transparent data sharing for the development of sound, effective Bay restoration policy. As veteran stakeholders, the members of CBFN understand the importance of making modern tool kits available to everyone engaged in the conservation effort.</p>
