In November 2013 Chesapeake Commons partnered with Center for Progressive Reform (CPR), leveraging public data and open source tools to map over 560 animal feeding operations throughout the state of Maryland.  The visualization supports CPR’s Falling Behind Issue Alert which highlights the department’s lack of internal capacity to issue animal feeding operation permits that are critical to safeguarding local and Bay water quality. The web mapping application calculates the amount of time it takes Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) to process and issue an operating permit on a farm by farm basis for the entire state of Maryland.

Specifically a user can see the geographic distribution of Maryland's Animal Feeding Operations, along with a set of farm-specific attributes.  Users are able to drill down to local clusters of farms over MapBox satellite imagery and view attributes such as operator, number of animals, animal type, and permit status.  The data powering the map originate from MDE’s public animal feeding operation search tool.  Records are maintained on a near real-time basis and can be downloaded in a variety of ready to use formats such as an excel spreadsheet, ESRI .shp file, and even GeoJSON.  The falling behind map highlights the power and value in cleaning up a public data set so it can be visualized in a way that helps move forward effective policies for the environment and safeguard water quality.
