This award honors non profit organizations who are most effective in leveraging technology to further their mission. Out of 29 organizations, Potomac Riverkeeper and Chesapeake Commons were awarded first place for the use and development of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-water-reporter/id668005311" target="_blank">Water Reporter App for iOS</a>. Water Reporter allows anyone with a smartphone to share memorable experiences on the water and submit pollution reports to a centralized database for followup and cross sector remedial action.

Water Reporter has been a flagship project because we have the privilege as developers to see our application get used and grow. The design and build of Water Reporter is only half the project's success. Equally important is the constituency adopting, utilizing, and leveraging the application to establish positive environmental outcomes. Potomac Riverkeeper and their followers are the boots on the ground collecting data, assessing pollution reports, and making sure local water quality issues are addressed, and we are proud to be part of the work.

So what's next?...Version 1.1; we can't celebrate too long because we're not about to become obsolete. 501cTech's award is confirmation to keep going and we will maintain our resolve to grind now, shine later, and keep producing outcome driven applications.
