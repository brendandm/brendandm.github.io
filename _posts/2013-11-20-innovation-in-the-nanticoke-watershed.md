In 2012, Burke Environmental Associates (BEA) and Chesapeake Commons collaborated with the Nanticoke Watershed Alliance (NWA) to better understand local areas in need of best management practices (BMP) and precision conservation strategies. Chesapeake Commons aided BEA in optimizing large scale data services for field use.

A significantly valuable product of BEAÃ­s analysis is the Nanticoke Modeled Flow Path Network. Using RiverTools software and digital elevation models for the watershed, the data service is able to represent a more complete picture of the hydrological connectivity between water bodies and highlight areas within the watershed that are most suitable for pollution eliminating BMPs. Chesapeake Commons worked with BEA to optimize this 600,000 feature data set for web and mobile use. This allows farmers and planners to better understand where and why BMPs should be implemented to curb pollution to the waters of the Nanticoke and inevitably the Chesapeake Bay.
