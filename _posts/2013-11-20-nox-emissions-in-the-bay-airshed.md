The Chesapeake Bay Airshed Model (or Regional Atmospheric Deposition Model) provides estimates of nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions from sources in all or part of sixteen states from South Carolina north to Michigan and east to Vermont. The model is three-dimensional and simulates the movement of airborne NO<sub>x</sub> both vertically and horizontally across the region. Monitoring stations operated by the EPA and NOAA collect model inputs for wet deposition (via precipitation) and dry deposition through hourly emission estimates and meteorological data.

Measuring approximately 350,000 square miles, the airshed is roughly five times larger than the Bay watershed. Airshed boundaries reflect the extent of practical control limits for NO<sub>x</sub>. Note that airborne pollutants have differing transport profiles and a more exact airshed would encompass most of the eastern United States.

In 2012, stationary EGUs in the United States generated nearly 1.68 million tons of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, according to monitoring data from the EPAÃ­s Acid Rain Program. Approximately 27% (444,184 tons) were produced by 278 facilities in the Chesapeake Bay airshed. Ranking this group by 2012 emissions, the first fifty sources accounted for 83.8% of the total NO<sub>x</sub> originating in the airshed. These fifty plants are distributed across ten states, two of which (Pennsylvania and Ohio) contributed 49.3% of emissions within the region.

Out of 1,137 plants for which emissions data were available from every year in the period 2008-2012, all fifty of the largest NO<sub>x</sub> producers in the airshed ranked in the top 24% nationwide for both five-year cumulative and average annual emissions. Further, the top ten plants in the Chesapeake airshed are among the top fifty (4.4%) nationally, based on five-year average annual emissions.

The map displays the top fifty power plants ranked by total 2012 NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Contextual data include owner/operator names, physical locations, plant and fuel types, and the status of controls for SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>. Base layers are provided by Esri with support from various federal agency partners.
