The source data for these bathymetric products were soundings collected by The National Ocean Service over the last 150 years (retrieved from the national archives held by the National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, CO) and Shorelines delineated by the National Ocean Service.  The Chesapeake Commons Team used the bathymetric product to generate 5, 3, and 1 meter vector contour lines.  Contour lines appear and disappear based on the extent specified by a user.  This data service is designed to be a purely cartographic and artistic representation of bathy-contour lines.  This service looks excellent when used with a grey scale or slate base map.
