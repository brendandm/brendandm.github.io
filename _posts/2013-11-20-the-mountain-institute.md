The Mountain Institute (TMI) believes one’s sense of civic responsibility, the initial ember of stewardship, begins with a vision of alternatives. To this effort TMI has been providing environmental literacy programs for youth from along the eastern seaboard, up the Potomac River, and across West Virginia’s communities for over 40 years. Much of the population in the region served by TMI sees pollution stressed streams every day but lack awareness. Many of those who do realize they are looking at an impaired stream and are not sure how the issue can be addressed. Addressing these understandings from a methodology of scientific exploration is the basis of TMI’s watershed education curriculum. From the very first grant proposal supporting water quality awareness, youth education programs in 2004, TMI intended to include a companion online data sharing and exploration map. TMI considered their web based map a key piece of the program but it remained an idea for eight years due to cost and lack of platform availability.  Working with Chesapeake Commons made it a reality.

TMI works directly with approximately 2,000 students and their teachers each year. These students come from across a wide geographical landscape, some near the Chesapeake Bay and some from within its headwaters. Many of them participate in TMI’s stream quality analysis activities. With a Chesapeake Commons partnership participants can now share the data they have collected over the years and will collect in the future with classmates, parents, and the general public in a visually compelling spatial and temporal environment. The developed, Mountain Streams Primary Map, allows participants to investigate their local watershed as well as others across the region.

Chesapeake Commons support allows participants to investigate their watershed using a catalog of base maps and layers, create and edit new layers such as the location of stream conservation and restoration sites, or to continually add information into Feature Services. With this technology a new objective is emerging within TMI programs. The development of a feature service called Student Observations combined with mobile technology is allowing participants to roam their watershed as assigned homework, or in their free time, to take snapshots of what they feel are positive and negative aspects in terms of water resources. The ability for photos to be uploaded with personal comments on why the student feels the feature is notable gives them a voice and allows teachers to evaluate the transference of classroom and field study content knowledge. As a crowd sourcing and civic engagement tool it also allows students to connect with one another and understand that they are part of a larger conservation-minded population.
