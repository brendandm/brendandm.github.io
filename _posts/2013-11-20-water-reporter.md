With 17 million people residing in this vast watershed promoting water quality and environmental stewardship at a local, headwater, level is crux to ensuring a healthy Chesapeake. Potomac Riverkeeper one the many organizations focused on Bay restoration through citizen engagement and advocacy, needed a quick and efficient way to crowd source data on pollution hotspots and recreation activities throughout the watershed. These citizen reports allow any involved small watershed organization to be the eyes and the ears of the river and help to remediate pollution areas based on citizen aggregated data.

The technological void was filled with a mobile app for iOS called the Water Reporter. If you run into a large scale trash dump, come across cows standing in the stream, or anything you feel doesn't look right use Water Reporter to take some photos, tag a few attributes, and send it to our network of partners for follow up. Activity and pollution data are shared through a live community map that is a living depiction of how and where people are using the rivers and tributaries of the Bay watershed and where local stream restoration must occur.

After a few short cycles of design, development, and user-focused improvements, we've released the first version of the Water Reporter app to the iTunes Store. We are excited because this app will have impact in two ways:

+ <strong>1. Access:</strong> We can use citizen-submitted data to get a better understanding of how the public is using the river and where.


+ <strong>2. Stewardship:</strong> We can use information that citizens collect on areas of concern to help identify areas in need of local restoration.
