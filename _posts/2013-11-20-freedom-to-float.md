The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) launched the Freedom to Float campaign dedicated to increasing the access to treasured and natural landscapes in an effort to promote both conservation awareness and appreciation for the Chesapeake's waterways. The NPCA understands the importance of preserving and utilizing water trails such as the Captain John Smith Chesapeake and Star-Spangled Banner National historic trail as recreation and tourism are critical to the Bay's regional economy and environmental sensibility.

In an effort to endorse the Bay's intrinsically valuable cultural services, story map applications were created to provide an interactive and informative tour featuring recreational opportunities along the Potomac River, James River, Anacostia River and the Upper and Lower Chesapeake. The map transforms data from spreadsheets, pictures and website links into an interactive application that allows users to easily access relevant cultural and recreational information on public access points throughout the Bay's historical and natural treasures.
